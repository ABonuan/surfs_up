Run analytics on weather dataset from Oahu to better gauge success projection for a surf shop

## Overview
The purpose for running an analysis for the months of June and December, is to determine the sustainability of the surf & ice cream shop as an all-year round business.  Oahu is a popular destination in general, but June is the peak of summer, and December is when the rain comes in.

## Results
- Stations registered temperature information by about 200 more counts in June than in Decemeber.
- Lowest temperature on Oahu in June vs Decemeber is 64℉ and 56℉, respectively.
- 25% of the time, the temperature is above 70℉ in June, and below 70℉ in December.

## Summary
Looking at the temperature data for the months of June and Decemeber, and over a span of several years, we can infer that the Surf & Ice Cream shop would do well all year round.  The weather is better in the month of June for this type of business because of the high temperature for most, if not all, days of the month- really good ice cream weather!  December may vary a bit in temperature, and is milder.  Business may slow down a bit for this month, but the temperatures are mild enough for ice cream.

Querying for precipitation for both months would help us further understand how the business would do.  Would people be inclined to go surfing and eating ice cream in the rain?  Maybe selling other products in Decemember will help sustain the shop in this month in particular.
